PONG GAME

I recreated the classic Pong Game developed by Allan Alcorn in 1972 using Python
and the turtle module.

I began by creating classes for each object (ball, paddle, score and the
separator dashed line) and controlled each paddle using the arrow keys 'w' and 's' (for
the first player) and key arrows "Up" and "Down" (for the second player).

Then I established the wall and paddle collision of the ball and made that each time
the ball hit a paddle its speed increased by 0.5.

The game ends when the ball passes by a paddle and a "Game over!" message is shown, indicating
who the winner is.
